python DRAGen.py


In DRAGen the WAGAN is responsible only for the generation of input data and has no further functionality in the generation
process of the RVE. The great advantage of the WGAN approach is however, that after the generator was trained an unlimited amount
of input data can be generated by the WGAN. Meaning, each generation from the network replaces a complete EBSD measurement
of the material. This becomes particularly important when several RVEs have to be simulated for the same material, as it is the case
for studies like those performed by Gillner et al. [37]. If instead of the .pkl-file a fixed experimental data set from a .csv-file is used
for the generation of multiple RVEs, the same grain from that data set may be used multiple times. In general the .csv-file should
contain a much larger number of grains than what actually fits in the chosen RVE volume. DRAGen randomly selects grains from
this file until the total grain volume equals the chosen RVE volume. Since the selection follows a uniform distribution the material
dependent distributions of the microstructure are not changed. It is however highly important that the data in .csv-file represents
all distributions correctly. The .pkl-file from containing the WGAN generator on the other hand produces a new set of grains before
the generation of each single RVE, which makes it very unlikely that the exact same input configuration for one grain will appear in
multiple RVEs. Also, every new set of data follows the distributions the generator was trained on. Therefore, the statistics is always
considered correctly.
Eventually the above mentioned .pkl-file can be used for further processing with the DRAGen RVE generator.
